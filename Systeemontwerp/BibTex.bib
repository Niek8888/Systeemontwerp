@article{Pt1000,
   abstract = {The PTF-sensor family combines a group of resistance temperature detectors (RTD) using a Platinum resistor in thin film technology as sensing element. The characteristic curve of this Platinum RTD's are complying with DIN EN 60751. The usage of Platinum as resistive material guarantees high long term stability A platinum RTD consists of a structured platinum film on a ceramics substrate, passivated by glass coating. The connection wires are protected with glass on the welding area. The connection wires are gold coated nickel wire or silver wire. Gold coated Ni-wire is preferred for welding applications with need of higher application temperature but can be soldered as well, whereas silver wires preferably used for solder applications with lower temperatures. Due to small outline and low mass this RTD has a low time constant; therefore it is a suitable solution for fast and precise feedback control systems. Sensors are packed as bulk goods in blister box. Features  R0: 100 1000 values available  TCR 3850ppm/K  Application temperature up to-50…600°C (Class B)  Various resistance tolerances ±0.24%, ±0.12%, ±0.06%, ±0.04% available  Size 2 x 2.3 x 1.1 mm³ (width/length/height) FC-geometry  Size 2 x 5.0 x 1.1 mm³ (width/length/height) FD-geometry  Size 2 x 4.0 x 1.1 mm³ (width/length/height) FF-geometry  Size 1.2 x 4.0 x 1.1 mm³ (width/length/height) FM-geometry  Gold coated nickel lead wire or silver lead wire Applications  Specific temperature feedback control  Medical  HVAC  White goods  Automotive  Industrial applications  Sensing element for plug-in probes  Platinum Temperature Sensor  Conformal to DIN EN 60751  Global interchangeability  Wide temperature range  Fast response time  Different tolerances  Different outline dimensions  Low drift over lifetime  Blister box packing},

@article{Wang2008,
	abstract = {In the central air-conditioning system, the control system uses traditionally single loop PID controller. The control structure is simple, but the performance is usually not satisfactory. In this paper, the thermodynamic model of the heat exchanger and air-conditioning space in the central air-conditioning system are modeled in mathematic. Based on the models, we propose a robust cascade control strategy for temperature control of air-conditioning system. The robust cascade control system aims at eliminating the disadvantages of traditional design via complete decoupling of the design and performance of two cascaded control loops. Finally, the three controllers, the designed cascade control, traditional cascade PID control and single PID control are simulated in central air-conditioning system. It is found that the setpoint response, the robust and the performance of the designed robust cascade control system are better than the traditional cascade PID control system and single PID control system. © 2008 IEEE.},
